<p>HEADS UP! About Clarifai API. <br><br><strong>1.<em>Clarifai API Updates, Models and Troubleshooting. </em> <em>Predict</em> model we will be using to <em>Armada Predict</em>...ohhh fancy!<br><br><strong>2. Clarifai recently added new client APIs.</strong> Their newest version would require us to run <code>npm install clarifai-nodejs-grpc</code> vs what you will see in the upcoming video which is <code>npm install clarifai.</code> As I said, different packages but they both do the same thing. Because this change is fairly new, we want to wait for the newer version to stabilize before using it. Therefore we are going to continue to use <code>npm install clarifai</code> since it still works and has no issues moving forward. I will be creating an updated video once Clarifai changes are stable. This happens a lot in the industry and whenever you see things like <em>"</em><a href="https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-javascript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>NOTE: For node.js users, this API Client is no longer supported</em></a><em>,"</em> it simply means that they are not adding new features to it, but the library will still work. <br><br><strong>3. Sometimes the Clarifai Models can be down or not working as they are constantly getting updated.</strong> A good way to check if the model you are using is up, is to check them on the clarifai website. For example, for the Face Detect Mode: <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection</a>. If that isn't working, then that means you will have to wait until their servers are back up. Another solution is to use a different version of their model that works like this one: `c0c0ac362b03416da06ab3fa36fb58e3`.<br><br>So compared to what you might see in the next video you might have to enter the above key:</p><p> so you would change from in the video:</p><p><code>.predict(Clarifai.FACE_DETECT_MODEL, this.state.input)</code></p><p> to:</p><p><code>.predict('c0c0ac362b03416da06ab3fa36fb58e3', this.state.input)</code></p><p><br><br>)<br></p>
