### Starting Out React with component class method

One thing you will notice with React is that because we always have to return just one element from a component, we end up wrapping a lot of our components in

```sh
    <div></div>.

```

BUT WHAT ABOUT SEMANTIC HTML YOU TAUGHT US ABOUT IN THE HTML SECTION ANDREI!??!!

You are right! React realized this was an issue, and with the newer version of React 16.2, they introduced something called Fragment to

[fix this issue](https://blog.logrocket.com/rendering-child-elements-react-fragments/)

props : never changes after rendering the fragment or displaying on the screen. it is  more or less statically available or reliable for memory build.. in summary props only only renders.

State: React state simply means the decription of the app.
A "state" is simply an object that describes the application

State Properties is able to change the value of what is rendered.

Understanding Contructor Properties : it is mostly useful with state properties or state methods.

#### Handling Events In React

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

-With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

[See MOre about event handling here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

## Promises in js

```bash
const promise = new promise ((resolve, reject)=>{
    if (true){
        resolve('stuff worked)
    }else {
        reject('Error, it broke')
    }
})

# let perform chaining
promise
.then(result =>{
    throw Error
    return result + '!'
})
.then(result2 ={
    console.log(result2)
})
.catch(()=>console.log('error!'))
```
